Final Project - Elisabed Sheshaberidze
This is my very first web development project! I completed a 3-month HTML/CSS course three years ago, and this project is my first attempt at applying what I learned.  
The project includes basic HTML structure and CSS styling to create a simple web page.  

Features
- HTML page structure with headings, paragraphs, and lists
- Basic CSS styling including colors, fonts, and layout
- Simple responsive design (optional)

Notes
- This project was forked from my other GitHub account.
- Since this is my first project, it’s a learning experience and there might be improvements I can make in the future.
