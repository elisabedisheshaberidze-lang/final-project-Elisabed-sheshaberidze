Final Project – Elisabed Sheshaberidze

This is my first web development project! I learned HTML and CSS in a 3-month course three years ago, and this project is my first real attempt to use what I learned.

What I Did
Made a webpage with headings, paragraphs, and lists
Styled it with colors, fonts, and layout
Added simple responsive design for smaller screens
Added hover effects for buttons and cards

Notes
This project is a learning experience, so it’s not perfect
Images must be in the images folder to display correctly
I learned a lot about HTML structure, CSS layout, and making pages responsive
